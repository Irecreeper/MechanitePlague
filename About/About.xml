A small mod that introduce the Mechanite Plague to your local Rimworld! Make use of a variety of weapons and tools to infect targets with the plague, then kill them to unleash mechanoid Bursters upon your enemies!

Then, once the Bursters have fallen in combat, dismantle their corpses to salvage more plagued mechanites to create even more plague-inducing tools! Whether it's firearms, blades, turrets, or mortar shells, there are many ways to infect your foes!

Comes with new guns, melee weapons, psycasts (with Royalty), research projects, and a new Mechanoid type to "plague" your Rimworld! Also works with Combat Extended!



Mod Version v1.3.0.2

Special Thanks to:
-Shakesthespeare, for weapon art
-Kasmex and Happy Taffy for the Burster art
-The folks on the Rimworld and Combat Extended Discord for programming tips
